## Installing the latest version of Ansible

Most distributions have an older version of Ansible installed.This is usually fine except sometimes you may need to use features from the latest Ansible.Use the following commands to update Ansible to the latest version.

Check version

```bash
ansible --version
```

If it's not the version you are looking for, check to see where it is installed

```bash
which ansible
```

If it lives somewhere like

```bash
/usr/bin/ansible
```

this is most likely due to your distribution installing it there.

Remove previous version

```bash
sudo apt remove ansible
```

Check to be sure it is removed

```bash
which ansible
```

You should see

```bash
ansible not found
```

check to see that you have `python3` and `pip`

```bash
python3 -m pip -V
```

You should see something like

```bash
pip 22.3.1 from /home/user/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

Install `pip` if the previous couldn't find the `pip` module

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

Install ansible

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

Confirm your version with

```bash
ansible --version
```
