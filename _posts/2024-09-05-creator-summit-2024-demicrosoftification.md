45Drives is De-Microsoft-ifying and leading the charge by replacing Windows with Linux desktops and replacing proprietary solutions with open source. This topic of "demicrosoftification" was discussed at the Creator Summit 2024 at 45Drives headquarters. I attended along with many other tech YouTubers in this space.  They also gave us a sneak peek at some new hardware too and an early look at some unique prototypes.

Thanks to 45Drives for inviting me to this event!  If you'd like to learn more about them you can here: <https://www.45drives.com/techno-tim>
