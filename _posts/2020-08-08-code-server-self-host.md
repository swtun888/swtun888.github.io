Have you ever wanted to run VS Code in your browser?  What if you had access to your terminal and could pull and commit code as well as push it up to GitHub all from a browser or tablet?  That's exactly what code server does!  In this tutorial we'll walk through step by step of how to install and configure code server to get it self-hosted in your homelab.We'll start with bare metal and virtualization and then work our way up to Docker, Kubernetes, and Rancher.Then, you don't have to carry around your laptop anymore! You can preserve battery life on the go and leave the intensive tasks to your homelab server.
