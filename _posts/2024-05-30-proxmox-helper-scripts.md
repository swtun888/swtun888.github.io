Proxmox helper scripts is a collection of scripts to help you easily make changes to your Proxmox  VE server along with installing many LXC Containers.  This makes installing, configuring, and maintaining your Proxmox server in your HomeLab along with many applications as simple as running a script.

We thank [ttek](https://github.com/tteck) for his contributions and wish him the best.  He has turned it over the the community and links in this post were updated to reflect the community version*

Check out Proxmox VE Helper Scripts on Github: <https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE>

- This is the new community version of the repo

## Notes

> *Note: Be sure to always inspect any script before executing it, whether local or from the internet!*
{: .prompt-warning }

You can find the website here: <https://community-scripts.github.io/Proxmox/scripts>

- This is the new community version of the site

If you want to execute scripts from a commit SHA (somewhat immutable), you can execute the script like so (commit SHA of the date this video was released):

- Visit the link with a commit hash <https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/blob/a4a1821822f0f00fde56bc9b1ebe7204f5e01c08>
  - This is the new community version of the repo
- Find your script (`homeassistant-core-install.sh`) choose the RAW option
- This will create a link like <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/a4a1821822f0f00fde56bc9b1ebe7204f5e01c08/install/homeassistant-core-install.sh>

You can now use this hash to execute this script.  This will ensure that you can run this repeatable (and not always latest)

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/a4a1821822f0f00fde56bc9b1ebe7204f5e01c08/install/homeassistant-core-install.sh)"
```

You can reuse this commit SHA for all other scripts (just replace the path)
