Are you trying to access your self-hosted services outside of your firewall?  Are you tired of trying to remember your IP when away, or worse yet, having your ISP change your IP address?  Have you not purchased a domain yet but want to access your own personal VPN?  If you answered "YES" to any of these, join me as we walk through this step-by-step tutorial and set up DuckDNS, the free dynamic DNS service, using Docker and then move on to use Rancher and Kubernetes.
