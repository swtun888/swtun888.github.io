_Samsung 57" Ultrawide and my Dell 4k monitor!_

### Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 57‚Äù Dual 4k UHD

- Dual 4k means they put 2 4k panels together
- 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time
- I don‚Äôt need this at all, 120Hz is great but what I really wanted was a specific ratio.
- Ratio is Important to me because I wanted to have a 16:9 ratio so that I could put 2 windows side by side and have them each be 4k, or one large one for editing
- One other cool thing is that it has a 1000R curve, which for me I think is one of the best curves, although  I haven‚Äôt used any other.
- This makes it feel more natural where the monitor is almost equidistant as I move my head when looking left and right.
- So how do you hold up a 40 lbs monitor?  Very carefully.  
- Took a while to find the right arm, since most monitor arms max out at about 30-40 lbs.  Ended up finding one that supports 44 lbs and it‚Äôs working great.
- I did this so I can adjust and and because the legs are gigantic
- It has RGB, kind of pointless unless someone is sitting behind you and you want to annoy them.  I only have it on for this video.
- Also, this arm has RGB too, which I promise is not the reason I bought it.  It can be toggled off too.

### Dell U2720Q 27‚Äù 4k IPS Panel

- You might be wondering why I have this when I have a gigantic monitor below?
- This is great when sharing my screen on zoom calls or when I do screen recordings for my videos so that I don‚Äôt have to share a super wide desktop that no one can see or have to only share a section of my screen.  I typically have it off until I need to do one of those things.

## Desk Organization

### Grovemade

_Having a desk system like this one from Grovemade freed up a lot of space on my desk_

- Designed and made in Portland, Oregon
- Simple materials - wood, aluminum, cork
- 46 inches wide, 9 inches deep
- Solid maple - warm, natural look
- Desk Shelf - Large Maple
- Also opted for a tray to store some things.
- This gives me 3 layers to store things that need to be out of the way but still have quick access to.
- I also went with this light gray desk pad.  This is my first real desk pad and I have to say, I think this one is perfect.  It has a great modem look, it‚Äôs just wide and deep enough, and it‚Äôs super smooth with some cushion.  My mouse slides so easily on it with the perfect amount of friction, it‚Äôs hard to explain but I really feel like this material helps me be more precise when using my mouse at the crazy high DPI I have it set at.
- Huge shout out to Grovemade for sending this desk set to help get my digital life in order!  If you‚Äôre interested, there are links in the [Where to Buy](#where-to-buy) section.  You can get 10% off by using the code `TechnoTim``
- I am also using this on my workbench.

_Streaming has never been easier with my Elgato gear!_

- Elgato Stream Deck + and Wave Link control audio live streaming and even my music.  - I have a Wave XLR for my microphones and I control all of the audio levels using the stream deck plus.  
- Huge shout out to Elgato for sending these after struggling so much with other audio setups.
- Then I have the first stream deck which I‚Äôve had for years which mostly controls OBS and smart lights in the room.

## Attachments

## Lights, Cameras, Action?

You might be noticing all of these things attached to my desk, up here I have a pair of Elgato Key Lights that help control my lighting when streaming and recording, then a bunch of arms.  These arms help move my gear into the best place possible

## Cable Management

This consists of velcro, the right power strips, an under desk basket, and a few systems underneath to hold cables and cords.  USB Hubs and switchers help tidy this up too and allow me to switch between Windows and Mac.

_Although my workbench is small, organizing it is key to getting projects done on time!_

- Behind me is my workbench
- This is where I build and test most of the things you see on my channel
- You can see a ZimaBoard and ZimaBlade here that I am testing and working on
- As you can see I also have the Grovemade desk shelf
- I can hide lots of things in the shelf
- I use this primarily for charging
- Wish there were a better way to to charge all usb devices, but tucking them under here is the best I‚Äôve found. If you know of a better way let me know in the comments!
