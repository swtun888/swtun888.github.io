Today I got rid of the slow and pesky microSD card in my Pi and replaced it with something MUCH faster in my Pi LED Panel.  Don't know what my Pi LED Panel is?  Check it out! This is my first video on the new channel [@TechnoTimTinkers](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnoTimTinkers) üéâ

## Notes

This project was built using [rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix)

After getting the new power supply I noticed a few odd things

- When powered via hat only with the new 5v/10a AC to DC power supply, the USB drive wasn't recognized
- When powering via USB-C 5v/5a the LED panel was too dim to display some colors so it looked distorted

I read the Pi hat [documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi) over and over, and no where did it mention that anything else was needed other than a large power supply.  I thought for sure it was now a hardware issue and was in over my head.  I dropped a message in a Discord that both [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/) and I are in and he mentioned checking out [this post](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/27708/is-setting-max-usb-current-1-to-give-more-power-to-usb-devices-a-bad-idea)

In that post it suggests to add `max_usb_current=1` to your `config.txt`.

I tested it and sure enough the Pi can now power the LED panel, the Pi, and the USB drive all from a single power supply connected to the hat. üéâ

Thanks Jeff!
