After moving some of my HomeLab servers into the new colocation I have so many choices to make when it comes to services and architecture! From networking, to VPN, to security, to hypervisors, to backups, and even DNS!  I NEED YOUR HELP!  Help me decide if I have created a solid foundation for my new HomeLab in a Colo!
