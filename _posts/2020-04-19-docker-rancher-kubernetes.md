If you want to set up Kubernetes at home using Rancher to run Docker containers, this is the guide for you. This is a step by step tutorial of how to install and configure Rancher, Docker, and Kubernetes for your homelab.In this video we set up and configure a Minecraft server in just a matter of minutes with some enterprise like features.You can use this same process to spin up other Docker containers at home on your server or desktop.

üì∫ [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILc0ywDVTk)

See all the hardware I recommend at <https://l.technotim.live/gear>

## Install Docker

To install docker, see [this post](/posts/docker-compose-install/)

## Install Rancher

The two paths in the workload configuration need to be reversed:

- `Path on the Node` should be `mc`
- `Mount Point` should be `/data`

You'll want to use a command similar to this so that there aren't any port conflicts with other services or kubernetes itself.

Also, you may want to consider pinning your docker tag to a version other than `latest` to make backing up and upgrading easier. See [here](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/tags) for the latest version.

```bash
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 9090:80 -p 9091:443 --privileged -v /opt/rancher:/var/lib/rancher --name=rancher_docker_server rancher/rancher:latest
```

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have a static IP on your Rancher host
- Be sure to use the ports above if you want to add SSL later and use commands in future videos
- The new UI is now the "Cluster Explorer".You can toggle between this and the "Cluser Manager" UI by clicking the button.
- Do not create workloads in the `local` cluster.This is a management cluster for Rancher.You should create new cluster for your workload, just like in this video.
