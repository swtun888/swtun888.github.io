LocalSend is an open source application that securely transfers files between devices without the internet.  It's cross platform meaning that it's available for Windows, Mac, Linux,  iOS (iPhone, iPad), and Android devices.  This is a great alternative to AirDrop or QuickSend and can send and receive files to other devices without a 3rd party service like Google Drive.
