After a few months of planning and building, I colocated some of my homelab servers in a data center!  There were so many unknowns like, how much does colocating server cost? Do you need to bring your own networking?  How do you even prepare for this?  Join me as we figure this all out!

And don't worry, I still have servers at home too!
