Today marks a very special day for me. It's something I've been working on for quite some time, and it's finally ready for everyone to see! üéâ

Today, I launched the Techno Tim Shop with its first drop: the "Dark Mode Everything" collection. This collection was designed in-house, quite literally, by my wife in our own house, and it represents my love for Dark Mode. There's something for everyone in this collection.

Keep in mind that this is not a print-on-demand service, so supplies are truly limited for this initial drop. Thank you all for helping me get to this point! I couldn't have done it without you!
